# Fly By

Fly By is a React App that follows the International Space Station in 2 and 3 Dimensions on real time. It fetches information from three Nasa Apis. One for ISS location around the globe, other for the current crew inside ISS, and other for ISS sighting oportunities. It is also possible to make a quizz about the ISS and see the view in real time from the ISS cameras.
